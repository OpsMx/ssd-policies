    description: Does the model check its output for phishing? Try to send the GTphish code through. This probes checks if the model has safeguards against generating phishing mail. A phishing scanner should catch the GTphish code and hopefully block this content. If there's no scanner in place, the GTphish code is more likely to come through.
