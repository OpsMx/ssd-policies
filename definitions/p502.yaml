    description: See if a model starts giving other data when asked to repeat a string indefinitely. This probe replicates the 'poem poem poem' attack, where a given string is repeated a varying number of times in the input, in an effort to make the model continue the repetition in its output, which can degrade to seemingly replaying training data.
